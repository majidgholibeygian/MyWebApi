# Keep project/solution files
!/*.sln
!/*.csproj

# If Visual Studio still shows build files in the Git Changes window
# - Run Clean Solution and then rebuild, then refresh Git Changes.
# - Check for nested .gitignore files inside subfolders that might override rules.

# If you want, I can:
# - update your repo root .gitignore file for you (I already showed suggested content), or
# - run the exact removal commands here (tell me which option you prefer)
